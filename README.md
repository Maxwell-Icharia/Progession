# Progession


It checks whether a sequence in a list list is arithmetic or geometric.


Consider the following arithmetic sequence;

		1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25, ...

The formula would be; 

		a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d, ... 

In which a is the first term and d is the difference between the numbers


Consider the following geometric progression;

		2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, ...

The formula would be;

		a, ar, ar2, ar3, ... 

In which the first term is a and the common ratio between numbers is r


The function would output  whether the input is geometric or arithmetic as shown in the examples above



Tests have been implemented to ensure functionality. This is done using nosetests.

The function is compatible in all python versions, if conflicts arise use the


		2to3 or 2to3 -w flag to switch between versions.
